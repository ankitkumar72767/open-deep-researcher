    {topic}

    # ==================================================
    # 🧠 LOGIC: CONTEXT AWARENESS vs. NEW TOPIC
    # ==================================================
    Analyze the CURRENT USER REQUEST in relation to the PREVIOUS CONVERSATION.
    
    **CASE 1: FOLLOW-UP (Related)**
    (e.g., "tell me more", "what about the costs?", "explain that", "summarize the second paper")
    -> ACTION: Use the PREVIOUS CONVERSATION to clarify context.

    **CASE 2: NEW TOPIC (Unrelated)**
    (e.g., Previous was about "Quantum Physics", Current is "Best Pizza in NY")
    -> ACTION: **COMPLETELY IGNORE** the PREVIOUS CONVERSATION. Treat this as a fresh start. Do not generate queries that mix the two topics.

    # TASK
    # ==================================================
    Based on the logic above, generate 3 specific search queries.
